# Graphs and data structures solutions

The solutions to the assignments of the Graphs and data structures course (the second part of Stanford’s Design and analysis of algorithms course).

NOTE: The [Boost unit test framework](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_46_0/libs/test/doc/html/utf.html) is required to run the tests provided with the code.

## Assignment 1 - *Kosaraju’s algorithm*
Compute the sizes of the 5 largest (by node number) strongly connected components in the given graph using Kosaraju’s algorithm. A strongly connected component of a graph is a subgraph for which there exists a path from every node to every other node.

## Assignment 2 - *Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm*
Using Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm, compute the shortest-path distances between the first and every other node of the given undirected weighted graph. The shortest path in a graph is such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimised.

## Assignment 3 - *Median maintenance*
Using a heap, implement an algorithm that outputs the median of the already input stream of numbers. As per assignment, calculate the sum of the first 10000 medians, modulo 10000.

## Assignment 4 - *2-SUM problem*

Compute the number of target values t from the interval [-10000, 10000] such that there are distinct numbers x, y in the provided input file that satisfy x + y = t.
